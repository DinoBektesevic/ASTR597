## Developer documentation

All astropy maintained packages follow the same developer workflow. This workflow is also very
 similar to the ones other open source projects follow, e.g. `numpy`, or `scikit-learn`, but nevertheless
  it is worth double checking their preferences before contributing.
  
Tip: Always consult the developer documentations from the latest (developer version) docs
 rendering rather as procedures may change or clarified compared to previous iterations. 
 Repos may include a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file, too which usually provides directions to start.
