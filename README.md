# Learning Astropy and Open-source Software Development

#### ASTR 597A  - 2021 Winter 

The course focuses on tools in the Astropy ecosystem, including the core library and its 
affiliated packages. It provides an introduction to the variety of functionality which is
available inside Astropy with hands-on Jupyter notebooks.
 
Topics include core functionality of units, quantities & constants; coordinates; FITS, ASCII,
and Astropy tables; modeling; WCS and images; timeseries. From the wider ecosystem, we will also
cover topics to access data with astroquery and to perform point-source photometry with photutils.  

We also cover topics related to open source contribution workflows, setting up
repositories with testing and documentation, including hands-on exercises of opening pull
requests and performing peer code review.
